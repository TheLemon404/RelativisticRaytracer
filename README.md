# Overview
This project is a small extension of the [Raylib Raytracer project](https://github.com/TheLemon404/RaylibRaytracer) I made previously. It curves rays around a singularity to create some interesting effects.

[!NOTE]
This is not at all physically based, and was simply a fun experiment I did with raytracing. Blackhole rendering/Reletivistic raytracing is far more complex and creates physicall accurate results.
